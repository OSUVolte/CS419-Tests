 *      First I had to learn what the casting on the inputString() function implied.
 *      Then I wrote a direct iteration of the symbols to get to the desired state
 *      every cycle. Then I altered inputChar to return a random character from the 10
 *      each cycle after realizing what the random function was doing down there in the
 *      main function section.
 *
 *      I also wound up editing the error message because I thought I was causing a problem on
 *      flip instead of actually having reached the completion several minutes beforehand.
 *
 *      Basically, I showed off my extreme lack of C programming language knowledge. I did,
 *      however, finally get a better handle on uploading files to my directory on OSU
 *      campus and running command line compiling commands as I've never had direct
 *      instruction on how to do it before. Being as this is my last term and I've been away
 *      from school for 15 years, it was never really covered last time I was there.
