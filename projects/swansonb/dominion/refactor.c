Assignment 2

playAdventurere and playSmithy are implemented as is in a separate functions with necessary local variables defined
other 3 are left as stubs
refactor tested by running playdom

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Made code style and maintainability changes to playSmithy() and playAdventurer()
defined constants for the number of cards to be drawn, used for loop for unconditionally decrementing and loop controlling variable
corrected bug in playAdventurer that would occur when there were 0,1 treasure cards in the players deck/discard pile
corrected bug in playAdventurer that adventurer card was not discarded (play could have more than one action and use the adventurer card more than once otherwise)
refactor tested by running playdom
