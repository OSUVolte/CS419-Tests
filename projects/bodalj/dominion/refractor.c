# Documentation of refractored cards

This file details the refractoring that was done to move the below cards to their own functions and the subtle
bugs that were introduced. There were existing function prototypes for some cards in `dominion.h`, so I have went
ahead and added my own prototypes there and/or reused those that existed for the cards I worked with. 

The prototypes were reworked to include passing the currentPlayer to the function as this is needed for every
card effect.
