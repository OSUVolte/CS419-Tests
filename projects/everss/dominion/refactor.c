Changes to the cards are as follows:
adventurer: The bug gives three drawn treasures instead of two.
smithy: Does not get discarded after use.
council room: Loops for i <= 4 instead of i  < 4, therefore giving three cards instead of four.
village: Only gives one additional action instead of two.
great hall: Gives +2 actions instead of +1.
