/*
 * playAdventurer:
 *
 * I made a couple of tweaks that aren't super obvious
 * changed shuffle state to <= so shuffling would happen more often
 * changed it so it didn't draw the top card, it would error out and try and draw something that was out of the array
 * "forgot" to include silver card
 *
 * playSmithy:
 * made incorrect for loop
 * set wrong trash flag for discardCard
 *
 *playVillage
 * incorrect number of actions
 * bad trash flag
 *
 * playFeast
 * changed While condition
 * incorrect for loop at bottom
 * removed statement that ends while loop for gaining cards
 *
 *
